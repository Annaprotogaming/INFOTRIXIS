This repository contains a Java project with four classes for file manipulation: CreateFile, FileWriteClass, FileAppendClass, and DeleteFileClass.

CreateFile: This class creates a new file named "dataemp.txt" using the File class. It checks if the file doesn't exist and creates it if so.

FileWriteClass: This class writes a specific data string to the "dataemp.txt" file using a FileWriter. It overwrites any existing content in the file.

FileAppendClass: This class appends the string "This data is appended..." to the existing content in the "dataemp.txt" file using a FileWriter. It ensures that the new data is added to the end of the file.

DeleteFileClass: This class deletes a file named "dataemp1.txt" using the File class. It checks if the file exists and deletes it if so
These classes demonstrate basic file handling operations in Java, including creating, writing, appending, and deleting files.
